# WIRELESS-SENSOR-NETWORK
We developed a wireless sensor network that uses Arduino and FSK-based CC1101 modules to transmit environmental sensor data without any reliance on IP addressing or standard Internet protocols. This provides a simple, affordable, noise-resistant, and scalable system ideal for environments where classic networks are too complex, too costly, or unavailable
